## Simple Brute Force
This repository houses a simple MD5 brute force cracker I made for fun. It's part of the [IT Security Tools](https://github.com/rskelley9/it-security-tools) repo I have, which is a collection of notes and small programs related to network security, encryption, browser security and more.
